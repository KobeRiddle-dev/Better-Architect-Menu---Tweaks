### Rename Categories

Renames all the verb category names so that all categories have nouns as their name.

Also renames certain other categories to be more consistent and understandable.

- Automate > Automation
- Build > Structure
- Entertain > Entertainment
- Fight > Security
- Furnish > Furniture
- Manage > Management
- Make > Production
    - Produce > Crafting
    - Process > Processing
- Store > Storage
- Transport (no rename)
    - Aerial > Air
    - Naval > Sea

### Animals

- Remove the Animal/Bedding subcategory and move animal bedding to Animals/Ranching.
- Move Fences to Structure/Walls and the standard fence gate to Structure/Doors.

### Area

- Combine Temperature Subcategories
- Combine Filth and Pollution
- Remove Terraforming Subcategory

### Automation

- Remove the Automation Category. In the future, will move factories subcategories to Production.
- Move Mechanoids subcategory to Biotech.

### People

- Move Childhood to Furniture (requires Biotech)
- Remove the People Category and move any remaining subcategories and items into More

### Power

- Combine all Power subcategories and make Power a subcategory of Resources

### Resources/Water

- Move Animal things to Animals
    - Animal Water Trough, Pet Water Bowl, and Litter Box to Animals/Ranching
- Move bathroom fixtures to a new Furniture subcategory called "Hygiene"
- Move Fire Sprinkler to Area/Firefoam (and rename it to "Fire Suppression").
- Move radiators to Area/Heating
- Move Washing Machine to Production/Processing

These patches leave Resources/Water with just water infrastructure, and the users of water are all in more sensible places. After all, you don't have the Electric Smelter in the Power category just because it uses electricity.

### World
- Remove the World Category.
- Moves Outreach to More
- Move Monolith to More.
