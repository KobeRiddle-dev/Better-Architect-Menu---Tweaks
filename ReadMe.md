# Better Architect Menu | Tweaks

## Toggleable Tweaks

### Automation Category

- Remove the Automation Category. In the future, will move factories subcategories to Production.
- Move Mechanoids subcategory to Biotech.

### Resources/Water

- Move Animal things to Animals
    - Animal Water Trough, Pet Water Bowl, and Litter Box to Animals/Ranching
- Move bathroom fixtures to a new Furniture subcategory called "Hygiene"
- Move Fire Sprinkler to Area/Firefoam (and rename it to "Fire Suppression").
- Move radiators to Area/Heating
- Move Washing Machine to Production/Processing

These patches leave Resources/Water with just water infrastructure, and the users of water are all in more sensible places. After all, you don't have the Electric Smelter in the Power category just because it uses electricity.

### Area

- Combine Temperature Subcategories
- Combine Filth and Pollution
- Remove Terraforming Subcategory

### No People

- Move Culture to More (requires Ideology)
- Move Childhood to Furniture (requires Biotech)


# Better Architect Menu | No Animal Bedding Subcategory

- Remove the Animal/Bedding subcategory and move animal bedding to Animals/Ranching.
- Move Fences to Structure/Walls and the standard fence gate to Structure/Doors.
