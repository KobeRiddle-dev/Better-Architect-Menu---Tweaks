## Toggleable Tweaks

### Automation Category

- Move Mechanoids subcategory to Biotech.

### Power

- Combine all Power subcategories and make Power a subcategory of Resources

### Resources/Water

- Move Animal things to Animals
    - Animal Water Trough, Pet Water Bowl, and Litter Box to Animals/Ranching
- Move bathroom fixtures to a new Furniture subcategory called "Hygiene"
- Move Fire Sprinkler to Area/Firefoam (and rename it to "Fire Suppression").
- Move radiators to Area/Heating
