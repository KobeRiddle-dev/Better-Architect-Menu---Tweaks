# Better Architect Menu | No Animal Bedding Subcategory

Removes the Animal/Bedding subcategory and moves animal bedding to Animals/Ranching.

Also moves Fences to Structure/Walls and the standard fence gate to Structure/Doors.

Recommended to be used with my other mod [Clean Categories: Dropdowns *Extended*](https://github.com/KobeRiddle-dev/Clean-Categories-Dropdowns-Extended).

## Mods Supported:

- Core
- More Animal Beds
- Any other mod whose beds inherit from `AnimalBedFurnitureBase`
